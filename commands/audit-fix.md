description: Audit→fix→verify loop — finds issues, fixes them, verifies fixes, repeats until clean or you stop
argument-hint: "[scope] [--full | --mini]"
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## What This Does

Runs a complete audit→fix→verify cycle:

1. **Audit** — find issues (full 9-dimension or mini 5-dimension)
2. **Fix** — Claude or Codex fixes the issues (your choice)
3. **Verify** — check that each fix actually resolved the issue
4. **Repeat** — if issues remain, loop back to fix

Continues until all issues are resolved or the user decides to stop.

## Model & Settings Selection

Follow the instructions in `commands/shared/model-selection.md` to discover available models and present choices.

- **Recommended model**: `gpt-5.3-codex`
- **Recommended reasoning effort**: `high`
- **Recommended sandbox level**: `workspace-write`
- **Include sandbox question**: Yes (fixes require write access)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine audit type and scope

Follow the audit type selection logic in `commands/audit.md` Step 1 to parse `--full`/`--mini` flags from `$ARGUMENTS`, check `{config_default_audit_type}`, and ask the user if neither is set.

Follow `commands/shared/scope-parse.md` for remaining argument parsing, skip pattern enforcement, and trivial scope check.

### Step 2: Run initial audit

Follow `commands/shared/codex-call.md` for availability test and call pattern.

If Codex does not respond, fall back to manual audit and STOP (no fix loop without Codex).

- **Command persona**: "You are a thorough code auditor. Report every issue with exact file:line locations."
- **Sandbox**: `read-only`
- **Approval-policy**: `never`

Use the audit prompts from `commands/audit.md` (full or mini, matching the chosen type). Run per file.

**Save the `threadId`** as `{audit_threadId}` for reuse in fix and verify steps.

Collect all findings into a structured audit report. Display it to the user.

If **no issues found** → report CLEAN and STOP.

### Step 3: Fix loop

**IMPORTANT**: Maximum **3 iterations** of the fix→verify cycle. After 3 rounds, stop and report remaining issues.

Set `iteration = 1`.

#### 3a: Ask before fixing

**Question 1 — Scope** (severity filter):

For a **full audit** (has Critical severity):
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Found {N} issues ({critical} Critical, {high} High, {medium} Medium, {low} Low). Fix them?"
  header: "Fix scope"
  options:
    - label: "Fix all (Recommended)"
      description: "Fix all findings"
    - label: "Fix Critical + High only"
      description: "Only fix Critical and High severity issues"
    - label: "Stop here"
      description: "Keep the audit report, fix manually"
```

For a **mini audit** (uses High/Medium/Low only):
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Found {N} issues ({high} High, {medium} Medium, {low} Low). Fix them?"
  header: "Fix scope"
  options:
    - label: "Fix all (Recommended)"
      description: "Fix all findings"
    - label: "Fix High only"
      description: "Only fix High severity issues"
    - label: "Stop here"
      description: "Keep the audit report, fix manually"
```

If "Stop here" → display final report and STOP.

**Question 2 — Who fixes**:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Who should fix these issues?"
  header: "Fixer"
  options:
    - label: "Claude (Recommended)"
      description: "Fix directly using Read/Edit — has full project context, precise edits"
    - label: "Codex"
      description: "Send to Codex for autonomous fixing — sandboxed, isolated"
```

Store as `{chosen_fixer}`.

#### 3b: Fix issues

##### If `{chosen_fixer}` is **Claude**:

1. For each issue in the filtered findings:
   - Read the file, understand context, apply minimal correct fix via Edit
   - Fix all related locations if needed
2. Do NOT refactor surrounding code — only fix reported issues
3. Do NOT delete code unless the issue calls for removal (dead code, unused imports)
4. After fixing, run available tests if the project has them
5. Show summary: `git diff --stat` + list of fixes applied

##### If `{chosen_fixer}` is **Codex**:

**Reuse the audit thread** via `codex-reply`:

```
mcp__codex__codex-reply with:
  threadId: {audit_threadId}
  prompt: "Fix the following issues from your audit. For each issue, make the minimal correct fix at the exact file:line location.

ISSUES TO FIX:
{filtered findings in file:line | severity | issue | fix format}

RULES:
- Fix each issue at the exact location reported
- Make minimal, targeted changes — do not refactor surrounding code
- Do not delete code unless the issue specifically calls for removal
- After fixing, run any available tests
- Report: what you fixed, what you couldn't fix, and any test results"
```

**Fallback**: If `codex-reply` fails (thread expired), use a fresh `mcp__codex__codex` call following `commands/shared/codex-call.md`:
- **Command persona**: "You are an autonomous code fixer. Fix every issue precisely at the reported location. Do not introduce new issues."
- **Sandbox**: `{chosen_sandbox}`

Update `{audit_threadId}` to the new threadId from whichever call succeeded.

Display summary: `git diff --stat` + Codex's fix report.

#### 3c: Verify fixes

**If `{chosen_fixer}` was Codex** — continue the same thread:

```
mcp__codex__codex-reply with:
  threadId: {audit_threadId}
  prompt: "Verify whether the following issues have been fixed. Check each file at the exact location.

ORIGINAL ISSUES:
{the issues sent for fixing}

For each issue report:
- FIXED — issue resolved properly
- NOT FIXED — issue still present (explain why)
- PARTIAL — partially addressed (explain what remains)
- REGRESSED — fix introduced a new problem (describe it)"
```

**If `{chosen_fixer}` was Claude** — use a fresh Codex call for independent verification:
- **Command persona**: "You are a verification auditor. Only check issues from the provided audit report."
- **Sandbox**: `read-only`

**Fallback**: If `codex-reply` fails, use a fresh call (same as Claude-fixer path).

#### 3d: Evaluate results

- **All FIXED** → proceed to Step 4
- **Some NOT FIXED / PARTIAL / REGRESSED** and `iteration < 3`:
  - Increment `iteration`, show remaining issues, ask:
    ```
    AskUserQuestion:
      question: "{remaining} issues remain after round {iteration-1}. Try fixing again?"
      header: "Continue"
      options:
        - label: "Fix remaining issues (Recommended)"
          description: "Send unfixed issues to {chosen_fixer} for another attempt"
        - label: "Switch fixer"
          description: "Try the other fixer (Claude↔Codex) on remaining issues"
        - label: "Stop here"
          description: "Accept current state, fix remaining issues manually"
    ```
  - "Fix remaining" → go to **3b** with remaining issues (same fixer)
  - "Switch fixer" → flip `{chosen_fixer}`, go to **3b**
  - "Stop here" → proceed to Step 4
- **iteration = 3** → proceed to Step 4

### Step 4: Final report

```markdown
# Audit Fix Report

**Date**: {today}
**Scope**: {what was audited}
**Audit type**: Full (9-dim) / Mini (5-dim)
**Fixer**: {Claude / Codex}
**Model**: {chosen_model} | **Effort**: {chosen_effort} | **Sandbox**: {chosen_sandbox}
**Thread ID**: `{audit_threadId}` _(use `/continue {audit_threadId}` to iterate further — Codex only)_
**Rounds**: {iteration count}

## Result: {ACCEPTED / PARTIAL / UNCHANGED}

## Summary

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Fixed | {n} |
| Not Fixed | {n} |
| Partial | {n} |
| Regressed | {n} |
| Total | {n} |

## Fixed Issues

| File:Line | Severity | Issue | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| ... | ... | ... | FIXED |

## Remaining Issues (if any)

| File:Line | Severity | Issue | Status | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... | NOT FIXED | {why} |

## Changes Made

{git diff --stat output}

## Next Steps

- Review changes: `git diff`
- Run tests: {project-appropriate test command}
- Commit: if satisfied with the fixes
- Revert: `git checkout .` to undo all changes
- Continue: `/continue {audit_threadId}` to address remaining issues
```

### Verdicts

- **ACCEPTED** — all issues fixed, verification passed
- **PARTIAL** — some issues fixed, some remain
- **UNCHANGED** — user chose to stop before fixing, or Codex couldn't fix anything
